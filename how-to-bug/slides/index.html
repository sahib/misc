* You know what bash is specifically.
* You know how to write shell scripts.
* You won't be an expert in anything.
* You ask questions immediately.
* You don't expect this workshop is complete.
* Some entertainment.</pre><div class="notes"><p>My expectations:</p><ul><li>You ask immediately when you did not understand something.</li><li>You can try commands in parallel.</li><li>You will be tested at the end.</li><li>You will not need to understand everything, but
it's good to have a mind map of things that are possible.</li></ul><p>Mythenmetzsche Ausschweifungen all day long.</p><p>Also: First try of those slides. Could happen that I forgot
something to explain that is obvious to me, but is not for you.
Please tell me early. I need the feedback to get the knowledge across.</p><p>Remember: Learning bash takes usually long and you just get the intro
today with the lemur-condensed knowledge. You need to practice it.</p><p>About 60 slides, so even if I do 1 slide per 2 minutes, we'll still end
up with several hours.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="1" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="1600" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="after-this-workshop">After this workshop... &#x1F9EA;</h1><img src="images/expert-beginner.png" width="110%" class="borderless-img" align="center"></img><div class="notes"><p>You should be able to learn stuff and pick things up.
I give you pointers on what to learn and can help
